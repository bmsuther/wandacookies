team building for baumkuchen

For step 1 and 2, please use the dictionary.txt file for the translations.  Additionally, please create a branch to fork from the master and merge for additions


Step 1 Create a dictonary.txt file which will hold the German words and their translation in English if there is a translation for it.

Step 2) Your task is to create a (funny) story with the given German words. This story is supposed to use at least 10 of the German words. Your story can of course be in English and incorporate the words in any way you want. This is supposed to be fun and lightweight, it is not about having a perfect story and has nothing really to do with SE just that you use Git and hopefully have some fun with your team members.
To do so you work on your story.txt file (put it in you repo). Each of you add one sentence at a time to the story and commit your one senntence. You can commit directly on master or create branches for it to practice working with branches â€“ might be a good idea (you can work asynchronously on this), if you get a conflict resolve it so the story still makes some sense or not ;-)).
Each sentence should use one of the 10 words (or more). So overall you will end up with roughly 10 sentences and each of you should write 2 of them (your 2 sentences should not follow one another), so be 2 separate commits with someone commiting in between. So you need to check in on this at least twice!
Each new sentence must be appended to the end of the story. It is not allowed to add new sentences anywhere else in the story.
When you are done then post your story AND your GitHub link to our #story channel with your group name as the first line.

Step 3) Individually, each of you should go to at least one other GitHub repo from another team (see links on #story channel) and contribute one new sentence to their story. It is your job to find out how you can contribute to a public repository!
One of you create a PullRequest.md document on your repository. Into this file each of you should put your name and the link to the PullRequest you created for the other teams repo! If this document is not there and your link is not there you will not get points for this.

Step 4) The team should review all incoming PullRequests and either approve or decline with a reason.

Step 5) Vote for your favorite Story with thumbsup on Slack #story.
